Assignment Identity Management, Privacy and Anonymity

This assignment is to investigate on data structures and algorithms
for identity management with emphasis on privacy and anonymity.

Identity management is an emerging area of research and market either in
the web2 or web3 context. 
Ultimately, they pursue a sovereign ID management such that 
each individual user manages and controls their ID information and data
in a decentralized manner ideally.

However, in this assignment, an attempt will be made to experiment on
a sovereign or semi-sovereign ID management in a centralized manner.

Input:

user's first name, last name, age, gender, primary language,
SNS login ID, email, roles, services, groups, permissions.

Output:
1. A privacy graph (make it to be both BFS with an arbitrary source and DFS traversable)
2. An anonymity graph
3. All-in-one graph dual-graph, one for users and another for groups on top of the users-graph)
4. Strongly-trusted(untrusted)-components
5. Shortest-trusted-path (single-source single-destination, etc)
6. Minimum-trust-spanning-tree
7. Mamximum-trust-flow

Each node represents a user or a group such that a multilayered graph is
constructed, one for users and another for groups and each user may belong to
none or one or multi groups.

There are various edges except the inter layer crossing edges such as
first-name-edge, last-name-edge, age-edge, gender-edge, primary-language-edge,
SNS-login-ID-edge, email-edge, roles-edge, services-edge, groups-edge, 
permissions-edge. Further, each edge can be declared either 
Private (or Public), or Anonymous (or Identified), namely PPAI.
For instance, a first-name-edge is drawn from user A to user B 
as declared private, means user A wants to decalre his (her) first name private
(i.e., hidden) from user B, or vice versa, and likewise an extensive PPAI relationships among
users and groups and etc can be explored.

A research question can be drawn on the, so-called, Zero-Knowledge-Proof (ZKP),
whether there is a way a query from a verifier (user A)
under this centralized PPAI environment for a verification on a certain proof
could be performed without violating the prover's (user B's) PPAI declarations. 
Note that the ZKP is defined in our own manner slightly different from
the conventional one. 
In fact, note that the ZKP could be rather naturally realized in the context of
decentralized environment such as blockchain by default, however, notice that the decentralized
identity management is beyond the scope of this assignment.

Therefore, the last output is 
8. Centralized ZKP algorithm
